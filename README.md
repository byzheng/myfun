# myutils

My useless utility functions for R.


## Installation

It takes very long time to install this package as this package is trying to install most of R packages for my daily usage. 

To install the latest development version: 

```{r}
if (!require("remotes")) {
    install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("byzheng/myutils")
```
